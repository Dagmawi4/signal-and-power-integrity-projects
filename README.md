# Signal and Power Integrity Projects

This repository contains two advanced projects completed as part of coursework and research in **Signal and Power Integrity (EE 486/586)**.  
Each project focuses on high-frequency PCB design and analysis, combining **HFSS simulations**, **parameter extraction**, and **Python modeling**.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Overview

### [Project 1: Metal-Ceramic-Metal Capacitor on Rogers 4003C Substrate](./Project1)
- Modeled a **metal-ceramic-metal capacitor** using **HFSS** to analyze impedance (Z-parameter) and reflection (S-parameter) across 2â€“15 GHz.  
- Investigated resonant frequencies, with a key resonance at **11 GHz**.  
- Materials: **Alâ‚‚Oâ‚ƒ ceramic**, **copper layers**, and **Rogers 4003C substrate**.  
- Includes:
  - HFSS project files and setup.
  - S-parameter and Z-parameter results.
  - Documentation of the modeling and analysis process.

### [Project 2: Microstrip Line Crosstalk Modeling with HFSS and Python](./Project2)
- Simulated **two closely spaced microstrip lines** in **HFSS** to evaluate **NEXT (Near-End Crosstalk)** and **FEXT (Far-End Crosstalk)**.  
- Extracted **S-parameters** and implemented a **Python model** to simulate NEXT and FEXT in the time domain.  
- Focused on understanding the relationship between PCB layout, coupling, and signal integrity.  
- Includes:
  - HFSS model and exported S-parameters.
  - Python simulation scripts for NEXT/FEXT.
  - Documentation of results and visualizations.
